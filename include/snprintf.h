/**
 * @brief Format a string into a buffer with size limit.
 * 
 * Follows C99 snprintf semantics:
 * - Writes at most (size - 1) characters plus null terminator
 * - Returns total characters that *would* have been written
 *   (excluding null), even if output was truncated
 * - If size is 0, nothing is written but return value is still
 *   the total length
 *
 * Built on top of vstrfmt's callback architecture.
 *
 * Note: uses static context, not reentrant. Safe for single-core
 * kernel use. Do not call from interrupt handlers while another
 * snprintf is in progress.
